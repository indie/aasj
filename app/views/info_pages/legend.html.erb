<h2>The Difference Between Open and Closed A.A. Meetings</h2>

<p>The purpose of all A.A. group meetings, as the Preamble states, is for A.A. members to "share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism." Toward this end, A.A. groups have both open and closed meetings.</p>

<p>Closed meetings are for A.A. members only, or for those who have a drinking problem and "have a desire to stop drinking."</p>

<p>Open meetings are available to anyone interested in Alcoholics Anonymousâ€™ program of recovery from alcoholism. Nonalcoholics may attend open meetings as observers.</p>
